start with the last 2 digits

Z: consider the current digits
either  A: a swap can be made
or      B: a swap cannot be made

A: make the swap, construct the final number
  increase the highest place value digit by the least amount available
  fill in remaining numbers to make the final answer as small as possible


B: try to incorporate another digit
either B1: a digit is available for incorporation
           incorporate the digit, return to Z:
or     B2: no digits remain
           no swap possible, final answer
